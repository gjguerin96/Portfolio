            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated from UC Davis in 2018 with a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science. After graduating, I moved back to my hometown San Diego.
                I work part-time as a social media manager for a small company. I am currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp with the UC San Diego extension.
                Once I complete the program I hope to work with nonprofits, using my skills to help worthwhile organizations build an online presence.
                In my free time I enjoy listening to music, playing chess, playing tennis, and cooking.
