# Portfolio


## Description
This is a portfolio that I can use to advertise my services to potential employers. It is a page that can hold my contact info and some of my best deployed projects that show off my skills. I do not have any deployed projects yet, so I just used placeholder links that can be updated later. Employers expect a job candidate to have a site like this, so building it is an important step to getting a good job.

In the process of building it, I learned a lot about flexboxes and CSS in general. CSS is very powerful, and you can accomplish much with it if you know how to use it. Building this site taught me a lot about how to use CSS.

## Usage
There are several links on this page. The three links on the upper right corner of the page in the navbar (see screenshot) each go to one of the main sections of the page to make navigation easier. In the middle section, My Projects, there are five cards that will each link to a deployed project once I have some. Each card has an image that will also be updated as I link to my deployed projects. For now, they are placeholder links that go nowhere. In the Contact Me section, there are three links that each go to a different way I can be contacted.
